HIM - "The Sacrament"

1. I hear you breath so far from here
   I feel your touch so close and real
   And I know
   My church is not of silver and gold,
   It's glory lies beyond judgement of souls
   The commandments are of consolation and warmth

Chorus:
   You know our sacred dream won't fail
   The sanctuary tender and so frail
   The sacrament of love
   The sacrament of warmth is true
   The sacrament is you
