HIM - "The Sacrament"

1. I hear you breath so far from here
   I feel your touch so close and real
   And I know
   My church is not of silver and gold,
   It's glory lies beyond judgement of souls
   The commandments are of consolation and warmth

Chorus:
   You know our sacred dream won't fail
   The sanctuary tender and so frail
   The sacrament of love
   The sacrament of warmth is true
   The sacrament is you

2. I hear you weep so far from me
   I taste your tears like you're next to me
   And I know
   My weak prayers are not enough to heal
   All the ancient wounds so deep and so dear
   The revelation is of hatred and fear

Chorus:
You know our sacred dream won't fail
The sanctuary tender and so frail
The sacrament of love
The sacrament of warmth is true
The sacrament is you

The sacrament is you
